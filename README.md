# Brief description about our website.

```
We will develop an online website to promote our new video games. The website will help in reaching a huge number of audiences, which in turn will increase our sales and profit.

Users of the website will be able to sign up/ log in to our website. They will not be able to access the online store without a log in. In addition, users will be able to add video games to their cart and checkout.

The website will have a user-friendly design.
